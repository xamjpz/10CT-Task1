# **Assessment Task 1 - UX Design**
**By: Max Perez**

# Project Proposal

## Design Brief

The objective of my project is to encapsulate the experience of characters in the book “The Tristan Betrayal”. The type of user experience this will be done through a video game. This game will be a choose your own adventure type, starting off with choosing a character to be in the book, and making several choices in the game in order to depict the character experiences. My target audience is teenagers and young adults, around 15-25 years old, as this game will require some level of maturity.

## Book Choice and Justification
The name of the book I have chosen is ‘The Tristan Betrayal”, written by Robert Ludlum. The book contains themes of romanticism, thriller, espionage and war. During world war 2, the Nazis are at the height of their power, France occupied, Britain is enduring the blitz and is under constant threat of invasion, America is neutral and Russia is in an uneasy alliance with germany. The main character, Stephen Metcalfe is part of a prominent family, and has romantic relationships with many desirable women. He is also a minor asset in the US secret intelligence forces in europe. However, the spy network that he is part of is getting dismantled, in the midst of war-torn Europe and he is left without any contact, actual orders, or a contingency plan. I chose this book because it appeals to my interests of World War 2, particularly on the events that happened behind the frontlines, and I feel like this book explores that concept very well. 

## User Experience Type
My project will take the form of a platform game. By choosing this, it allows users to experience how the events took place within the book such as the challenges they faced, both physically and in the choices they make. This will be done through an interactive platform game with different cutscenes in between levels to help further the understanding of the context and events that happen within the book.

## Target Market
My intended audience would be individuals between the ages of 15-25  years old. They would have to require some level of maturity, because the themes that this book covers are quite graphic, even though the game will not actually be as violent to that extent. However, anyone who has an interest in World War 2, or espionage or even a bit of romance can enjoy the game. This project will appeal to them because it represents the difficulties, challenges and special moments that characters would face. It would also depict the significant events that happened in World War 2 in a fun, informative way. These design choices will cater to the audience because everything that happens in the book will be represented in a fun interactive game that conveys all of the events in the book in a way that both challenges and appeals to the person's interests and values. 

##  Software and Tools 
The software I plan to use: Unity, Excalidraw and Piskel. I would use Unity to make the game itself, editing the files and code from a previous game to make my game. Piskel will be used to create the sprites and characters in the game. Excalidraw will be used to plan the game with a mind map. All of these things will be suitable for my project because for me, it would be the easiest way to make my game. 

## Three-Tiered Mind Map

## Evaluation:

**Design Elements** - the design elements includes levels and characters inspiration and a colour palette, which represents what I plan the game will look like, regarding the aesthetics. The aesthetics for the game will probably be feasible as I can get a variety of colours from piskel, and I can design characters and backgrounds however I want. The impact of the design elements would have a heavy impact on the game itself because it will depict the feelings that the players would feel when playing the game itself, impacting the level of engagement of the players and would also represent the settings and different locations in the book. The very contrasting colours and design elements would be very effective in making the players more engaged to the game, and help them to be constantly invested in order to finish the game. 

**User Interaction** - the user interaction includes levels and information in levels, which shows the structure of what the game and how players would go through the levels and get information about the book. Making the levels themselves and the information before, in, and after levels would prove to be the hardest part for me, as I would have to learn how to do this the most efficient way possible, as for me this area of the project I have the least amount of knowledge in. However, it is still feasible. The user interaction would have a very significant impact on the whole game as it is basically how the players actually play the game. If the players cannot play the game, then the entire game would not work. I feel having many different levels, with different themes, different objectives and different types of levels would really engage with the audience and make it very effective with the interaction of users. 

**Key Themes** - the key themes includes themes of book from inspiration and in game, which basically shows what type of games I am taking inspiration from, to show what the game will turn out to look like in terms of type of game, and the themes of the book are listed to show what sort of themes the game will try to depict throughout it's levels. Depicting these themes throughout the game would be very feasible, as most of the key themes would be represented through the design elements, the type of games that the levels would be, and the type of information that would be communicated to the players. Portraying these themes in the game would be very effective in expressing the themes of the book itself.  

## Functional Requirements

- **Purpose of the Application**
    - The game will allow users and players to explore the different events that happen in the book, through the point of view of a few different characters. This game is design to engage fans with the book, as its not really a promotion of the book itself, more as something fans can play because they already enjoy the book. 
- **Use Cases**
     - *Choice of Character*: before playing the game, the player will have to choose what character they will play. For example, they could play Stephen Metcalfe, the main character, or Svetlana Baranova, the main characters former lover, who also plays a crucial part in the book. The choice of character will determine which side you play for, the type of actions that you'll have to make, and also the different things that will happen to you. 
     - *Character Backstory*: the player can choose to view the characters back story, which can provide some crucial context and potentially clues on how to solve the level, as well as the general information within the book. For example, the player can view the backstory of Stephen Metcalfe, learning that he can use the most obscure of items as a deadly weapon, which can help the player within levels.
    - *Clues*: if the player is having some trouble with the level, and they need some help, by clicking on the clue button, they will be provided with some extra assistance. For example, if the player cannot solve a puzzle in the level, they can click on the clue button which can tell them the answer of one of the puzzles, or might simply tell them to look closer at the title of the level.
    - *Menu Button*: if the player wishes to pause the game, quit, or change the level they are on they can click the menu button to choose a button to do the respective action.
- **Text Cases (Planned)**
    - *Choice of Character*: When the player first starts the game, they will have to read through the background information, providing information about the characters that they will have to choose from. But after that, an option will click up on which character they want to play. I will test these features by manually clicking on each button for each character, and will determine whether it works. 
    - *Character Backstory*: The player will recieve the character backstory when they first check on the character, but if they wish to see the backstory in the level, then they will have to go to the menu, and choose the button that says "Character Backstory". I will test this by choosing the character first, then clicking on the menu during a level and clicking the "Character Backstory" button. I will do this for each of the characters.
    - *Clues*: By clicking on the clue button, also located in the menu dropdown, it will take you to a screen which tells you the clue for that respective level. I will test this by choosing a character, going through all the levels and checking the clues for each level. I will repeat this with each character.
    
## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
    - The game will deliver smooth, seamless transitions between different game screens and scenes, with minimal delay. Character movement and actions will also be smooth with almost no delay and the different buttons that will be clicked will provide good transitions between different scenes. 
- **Usability**
    - Some design features that I will include to ensure maximum usability are:
    - *Consistent Layout*: Having a consistent layout will make sure that it will be easier for new players to learn how to play the game, as well as helping them get familiar with the game quicker. 
    - *Evident Buttons*: By making the buttons very easy to see and differ from the background, the player will be able to easily determine which button to click, and to know which button will do what action, hence less confusion when playing the game. 
    - *Easy Controls*: Having easy controls for the game will make it so much easier to play the game itself, maximising the satisfaction the players will feel when playing the game.
- **Reliability**
    - In order to ensure reliability, I will make sure to run consistent tests for each action of each character and button, making sure that whatever happens will move smoothly. Since this is mainly designed as a laptop/PC game, I will not have to test across different devices, and will just have to test between different screen sizes, which shouldn't be too much of a problem. 
- **Security**
    - The app will not be collecting any user data besides the gameplay of the player. The data will be stored locally on their device. 

## Social, Ethical and Legal Issues 
- **Social Impact**
    - *Target Audience Considerations*: The targetted audience for this game will be teenagers and young adults, around 15-25 years old. There wont be many  accessibility considerations, as the controls for the game is designed to be very easy to learn and use, however the game might have difficult levels that will not account for the specific accessibility needs of other people. 
    - *Potential Benefits*: My game will positively impact the community of the book, as the game is designed to hook players that are already interested in the book, and help them to enjoy the book even more through playing the game. After the players complete the game, there will be a message to share the book with their friends and to show them the game too, encouraging people to read the book and play the game.  
    - *Potential Risks*: There are a few minor risks that are in the game. Some certain groups of people might be misrepresented, such as the KGB (Russians) and Germany, which are portrayed to be the villans in the book, but if you play as Svet Lana, the French and America will be portrayed as the villans. Furthermore, the game will be an oversimplifcation of the events in the book, and may include missleading information about the events of World War 2. 
- **Ethical Responsibilities**
    - *User Data & Privacy*: The prototype will only collect the data of the gameplay of each character, which will be stored locally on the file on the laptop/PC. No one else will have access to the file on their computer, only them. 
    - *Represenetation & Inclusion*: The project will aim to equally represent all characters, themes and ideas from the book. This will be done through the fair representation of all features in the game. Before the levels start, the player will have a choice to choose between characters, providing a backstory for each one. The themes of the book, which are mainly about World War 2, will also be equally depicted, making sure to include both sides in the book. The ideas of betrayal and espionage in the books will also be portrayed fairly, through the different levels that all characters will have to face. 
    - *Content Sensitivity*: Some topics in the book can be interpreted as controversial or sensitive, but that is also why some level of maturity is required to play, and read the book. The game will not exclude certain sensitive topics like Nazi Germany and Hitler as they are what the book is about, but will filter out any profanity and sexual references, ensuring that the game will only require the most necessary of controversial themes. 
- **Legal Consideration**
    - *Copyright & Intellectual Property*:
